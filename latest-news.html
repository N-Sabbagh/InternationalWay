                <p>Date: 2003 - 2024</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The whole estate (blocks & communal gounds) used to be managed by HML.</li>
                    <li>Since 2015, blocks started going for the Right To Manage (RTM), starting by Block H!</li>
                    <li>This was then flollowed by more blocks going for the RT; Blocks C/D, B, F, K, AA, Ab, Ac & AD. However, HML still managed the communal areas of the estate, as well as some other blocks.</li> 
                    <li>The residents finally managed to form an RMC and took over the management of the communal areas, as well as Blocks L, G and J.</li>
                    <li>For more information on who manages the various parts of the estate, click <a href=about.html#blocks>here</a> to visit the <b>About</b> page.</li>

                <h3 style="color:#a92a0e">Block H</h3>
                 <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Block H (Flat 84 - 91) was the very first block to acquire the Righ To Manage (RTM) in the estate. We had major resistance from HML, and had to go to the First-Tier Tribunal (FTT) and win the case (without any solicitor services!). We formally acquired th RTM back in May 2015!</li>
                        <li>We have been self-managing our block since then.</li>
                        <li>In 2017 we enbarked on a major program to paint the exterier of the block (using a very special paint that cleans itself after it rains), painted the railings black, cleaned/restored/sealed all the fascia as well as fixing the roof</li>
                        <li>Replaced the original old, communal lights to LEDs, and replaced all the sensors & communal smoke alarms too</li>
                        <li>Installed 24hr CCTV, which was later updated to the latest technology</li>
                        <li>In 2024 we replaced the building signs & fixed the intercom system.</li>
