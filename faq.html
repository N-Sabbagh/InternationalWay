                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>There are 3 main vulnerable areas where the public can enter International Way. By the play park into Lincoln Way, by CD block onto Windmill Road and by E block onto Windmill Road.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>The site has many visitors from Lincoln Way and elsewhere. We have many reports that our play park is being used by youths who cause damage that we have to repair. We have reports of Lincoln Way residents entering the site to exercise their dogs and don't clear up their dog mess.</p>
                    <p>CCTV has shown us that we have visitors to the site in the hours of darkness who are checking for unlocked cars and stealing from the carports and insecure communal areas. We are vulnerable to drug dealing and have several issues that have now been resolved and we want to keep the site free from drug dealers and those buying drugs.</p>
                    <p>The site was sold to many under the guise of it being secure.</p> 
                    <p>To make the site as safe as possible for all of the residents.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>We intend to review whether or not the fences achieve the desired objective. If it does, we intend to install permanent fences with gates to allow leaseholders and tenants to come and go through these 3 areas.</p>
                    <p>If it does not we will discuss what measures need to met to achieve a secure site.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>It has not been decided yet and we will seek advice from professional installers. Our intention is to install gates with fobs, key or number lock access for resident use only. Any fences / gates will be in keeping with existing designs and colours across the estate.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>We don't know yet as we are in the planning stages. We anticipate a cost less than £10,000 and it will come from existing reserve funds. No leaseholder will be asked to contribute more for it.</p>
